## Summary
Users are able to search for a city and are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history. Search results include city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, the UV index (color coded to indicate whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe), and finally a 5-day forecast.
